# Case Study- Cyclistic Bike Share
##### This analysis is a capstone project case study in the Google Data Analytic Certificate course through Coursera.
### Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of
marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your
team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will
design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your
recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### Characters and teams
* Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart
by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities
and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use
the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each
day.

* Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and
initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.

* Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting
data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about
Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.

* Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the
recommended marketing program.

### About the company

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are
geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to
any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One
approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and
annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who
purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing
flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to
future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good
chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have
chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

**Moreno has set a clear goal:** Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do
that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual
riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in
analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.


Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Moreno has assigned you the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

Conclusion

```Top three recommendations based on analysis```

* *Educate casual riders on the perks of memberships and make membership more alluring to long usage casual riders.*

* *An ad campaign at the popular start stations for casual riders can increase engagement or interest in memberships.*

* *A campaign to increase the usage by members especially in the less popular months could increase the number of trips. This campaign should provide benefits or rewards for continued usage with a focus on the less popular months.*

```What is your final conclusion based on your analysis?```

*There are casual riders who are using the bike sharing more than members and with a targeted digital marketing campaign as well as marketing campaigns around high traction start and end stations of casual users may convince them to convert to members. Therefore there is an opportunity for Cyclistic to turn casual riders into annual members.*

```How could your team and business apply your insights?```

*To start digital marketing campaigns, the campaign would focus on the benefits of being a member over a casual rider for longer rides, hence targetting casual users who have longer ride durations. Also promotions to attract customers during bearish months namely January, February and December and price hikes in stations with high number of casual users where campaigns showcasing benefit of annual memberships including priority for bike allocation for members could be showcased.*

```What next steps would you or your stakeholders take based on your findings?```

*A more in-depth analysis on the long use casual riders is needed however there is enough data to support a marketing campaign.*

```Is there additional data you could use to expand on your findings?```

*Additional data that would expand the findings would include: demographic data, climate data, financial data, data on repeating casual users and marketing campaign history with their ROI.*
